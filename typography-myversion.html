<!-- Paragraph -->
<p><b>HOMERIC or HEROIC PERIOD (1200-800 BCE)</b></p>
<blockquote><i>Greek legends were passed along orally, including Homer's The Iliad and The Odyssey. This is a chaotic period of warrior-princes, wandering sea-traders, and fierce pirates. </i></blockquote>
<p><b>CLASSICAL GREEK PERIOD (800-200 BCE)</b></p> 
<blockquote><i>Greek writers, playwrights, and philosophers include Gorgias, Aesop, Plato, Socrates, Aristotle, Euripides, and Sophocles. The fifth century (499-400 BCE) in particular is renowned as The Golden Age of Greece. This was the sophisticated era of the polis, or individual City-State, and early democracy. Some of the world's finest art, poetry, drama, architecture, and philosophy originated in Athens.</i></blockquote>
<p><b>CLASSICAL ROMAN PERIOD (200 BCE-455 CE)</b></p>
<blockquote><i>Greece's culture gave way to Roman power when Rome conquered Greece in 146 CE. The Roman Republic was traditionally founded in 509 BCE, but it was limited in size until later. Playwrights of this time include Plautus and Terence. After nearly 500 years as a Republic, Rome slid into a dictatorship under Julius Caesar and finally into a monarchial empire under Caesar Augustus in 27 CE. This later period is known as the Roman Imperial period. Roman writers include Ovid, Horace, and Virgil. Roman philosophers include Marcus Aurelius and Lucretius. Roman rhetoricians include Cicero and Quintilian.</i></blockquote>
<p><b>PATRISTIC PERIOD (c. 70 CE-455 CE)</b></p> 
<blockquote><i>Early Christian writers include Saint Augustine, Tertullian, Saint Cyprian, Saint Ambrose and Saint Jerome. This is the period when Saint Jerome first compiled the Bible, Christianity spread across Europe, and the Roman Empire suffered its dying convulsions. In this period, barbarians attacked Rome in 410 CE, and the city finally fell to them completely in 455 CE.</i></blockquote>

    <h6 class="left-align"><b>II. The Medieval Period (455 CE-1485 CE)</b></h6>
</div>
<!-- Paragraph -->
<p><b>THE OLD ENGLISH (ANGLO-SAXON) PERIOD (428-1066 CE)</b></p>
<blockquote><i>The so-called "Dark Ages" (455 CE -799 CE) occured after Rome fell and barbarian tribes moved into Europe. Franks, Ostrogoths, Lombards, and Goths settled in the ruins of Europe, and the Angles, Saxons, and Jutes migrated to Britain displacing native Celts into Scotland, Ireland, and Wales. Early Old English poems such as Beowulf, The Wanderer, and The Seafarer originated sometime late in the Anglo-Saxon period. The Carolingian Renaissance (800- 850 CE) emerged in Europe. In central Europe, texts include early medieval grammars, encyclopedias, etc. In northern Europe, this time period marks the setting of Viking sagas. </i></blockquote>
<p><b>THE MIDDLE ENGLISH PERIOD (c. 1066-1450 CE)</b></p> 
<blockquote><i>In 1066, Norman French armies invaded and conquered England under William I. This marks the end of the Anglo-Saxon hierarchy and the emergence of the Twelfth Century Renaissance (c. 1100-1200 CE). French chivalric romances--such as works by Chretien de Troyes--and French fables--such as the works of Marie de France and Jeun de Meun--spread in popularity. Abelard and other humanists produced great scholastic and theological works.</i></blockquote>
<p><b><i>Late or "High" Medieval Period (c. 1200-1485 CE)</i></b></p> 
<blockquote><i>This often tumultuous period is marked by the Middle English writings of Geoffrey Chaucer, the "Gawain" or "Pearl" Poet, the Wakefield Master, and William Langland. Other writers include Italian and French authors like Boccaccio, Petrarch, Dante, and Christine de Pisan.</i></blockquote>
